story:

(The first room is where the player will start. You can call them 'room' or 'place'.
The text in quotes is the description of the room.)

The hallway is a room. "This is a bright corridor. Sunlight is streaming in through the door's window. The floor is paved in old patterned tiles. To the north, there's a living room, and the kitchen. The dining room and a bedroom are south. Wooden stairs go up at the east end.".

# Other rooms can be placed relative to previous ones, using the directions you created

The living room is a room north of the hallway. "The living room feels comfy and alive.". It is locked.

There is a coffee table in the living room. "An old, wooden coffee table. There are some magazines thrown haphazardly on here along with a couple of remotes".

A TV is a thing in the living room. "A small flatscreen TV, barely hiding a mess of various cables going to battered consoles".

The dining room is a room south of the hallway. "There are bookcases around. The hallway is north".
