## Compass Engine

Compass is an experimental engine for interactive fiction. It's heavily inspired by Inform7, but I wanted something simpler in some ways, different in others, and mostly liked the challenge of writing a parser for this. It's very early in the development still, and I wouldn't recommend anyone rely on the syntax not changing, but feel free to experiment.

## Immediate roadmap

- [ ] default verb enabling/disabling
- [ ] in/on/under location support + opening things
- [ ] support for default properties
- [ ] better object/object matching system
- [ ] lock support (move to bytecode later?)
- [ ] compilation/loader systen
- [ ] custom actions & bytecode support
- [ ] basic adjectives recognition
